# NBA-Rebounds-Project
 
The purpose of this project is to practice my EDA skills using SQL and Python by exploring how rebounding, particularly from players in the "Guard" positions, has evolver in the NBA over time. This is done mostly by visualizing the data through Plotly, as well as creating a dashboard using Dash.

The project utilizes [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumitrodatta/nba-aba-baa-stats) dataset, a part of which I converted to a SQLite Database, and a Medium [story]((https://medium.com/@davidve0206/evolution-of-nba-rebounding-b1aef152c715)) explains the narrative behind the Jupyter Notebook that can be found in this repository.
